# Digitaltesting
The documentation for the digital testing of MASS and modifications, based on the ShipAI basis. 

The project aim to create a list workflow of possible agents for training the intentional scenarios of safety risk in maritime series, the task is mainly distributed into two parts.
First is the follow-up mode of the trace, which the adversarial scenario get into the starting point and move up according to the generated and existing route data.
Second is the free chase mode, when the two ship reach the selected area the freedom is given and the catch-up race is then assured.

## The data generation and evaluation part
The data is not included in the files for the generation as concluding sensitive data, generation models are used in the variance from TSGM built-in models and self-built models based on different networks, which are listed in the train_() files  
Evaluation and transition of the data to the scenario in the input are listed in the evaluation and abstraction documents.

## The Training and simulation part 
The simluation and the training for the part are referred to the simulator in the ShipAI and Stable-baselines 3 as baseline for the structure, and the files are in the Shipenv_re document
